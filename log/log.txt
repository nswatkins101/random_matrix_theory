Using C and GSL to compute eigenvalues for inverses quickly, for numerically testing random matrix theory results. First, I will write a program to calculate the empirical limiting distribution of the spectrum
of a matrix using n~1000. Going to create a loop in which I generate a random matrix according to some fixed function, calculate the eigenvalues with GSL, bin the eigenvalues, add that histogram to some 
total histogram, then at the end of the loop normalize the histogram and write it to a file. I am hoping to eventually introduce some plotting functionality to the C code, but for now, Mathematica is much
more flexible with plotting styles.
